# Git Activity App

This project was created with create-react-app to accept a users name and then search for / display their activity on github. 
- React Hooks for state management and lifecycle features
- Semantic Ui for styling.

Feel free to play around and dont hesitate to make any imporvements or critize:)

Thank you

Victor
